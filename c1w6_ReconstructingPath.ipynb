    "# Reconstructing the path\n",
    "In this assignment you will use Spark to compute the shortest path between two vertices. In the video, you have learned how to compute the distances between a source vertex and all other vertices in a graph. Now, your task is to reconstruct the shortest path, that is a sequence of vertices connected by the edges.\n",

    "Your task is to find the shortest path between vertices 12 and 34. In case of multiple shortest paths (that is, disjoint paths with the same length), any will suffice. Output format is the sequence of vertices, delimited by a comma, without spaces. For example, the path “12 -> 42 -> 34” should be printed as:\n",
