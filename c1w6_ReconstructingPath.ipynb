    "# Reconstructing the path\n",
    "In this assignment you will use Spark to compute the shortest path between two vertices. In the video, you have learned how to compute the distances between a source vertex and all other vertices in a graph. Now, your task is to reconstruct the shortest path, that is a sequence of vertices connected by the edges.\n",
